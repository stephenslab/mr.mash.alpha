# mr.mash.alpha

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/stephenslab/mr.mash.alpha/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/stephenslab/mr.mash.alpha/actions)

R package implementing methods for multivariate multiple regression
with adaptive shrinkage priors (mr.mash).

## Quick Start

Install and load the package using [remotes][remotes]:

```R
remotes::install_github("stephenslab/mr.mash.alpha")
library(mr.mash.alpha)
```

Note that installing the package will require a C++ compiler setup
that is appropriate for the version of R installed on your
computer. For details, refer to the documentation on the
[CRAN website][cran].

This command should automatically install all required packages if
they are not installed already.
